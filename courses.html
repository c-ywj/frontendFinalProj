                            In addition to completing iOS development training, this course incorporates professional presentation, team collaboration, communication, and technical skills covered throughout the program with two major projects and four career preparation sessions.  Both projects challenge participants to research and assemble new software applications in teams. The first project is an internal web project which simulates an industry setting.  The second project involves a four-week term in partnership with an industry client to build a web site or web site component. Both projects require agile project management, effective systems analysis and design, communication of design and progress, source code management, and data driven development using current best practices.
