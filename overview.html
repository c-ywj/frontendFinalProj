                    <section>
                            <p>The Software Systems Developer (SSD) program (Web Programmer option) is an eight month,
                                    full-time business application development program offered by BCIT's School of Computing
                                    and Academic Studies, within the HTP department at the downtown Vancouver campus.</p>
                            <p>It prepares individuals for high-demand careers in the technical areas of web application
                                    development, programming, database and systems analysis. Students learn industry-ready
                                    skills through extensive hands-on practice in current scripting and coding techniques,
                                    object-oriented architecture patterns, application security and scalability, developer tools,
                                    and platforms for building complete web-based business applications from scratch. <br>
                                Graduates of this certificate program may apply for acceptance into the BCIT Bachelor
                                    of Technology in Computer Systems (additional prerequisites are required). </p>
                            <p>This program is delivered through classroom instruction, hands-on lab work and
                                    individual and team projects.</p>
                            <p>While applicants are not required to have formal computer programming experience,
                                    they need to have a solid understanding of object oriented programming as well as possess
                                    sound logical and reasoning skills. Applicants with no knowledge are advised to take a programming
                                    language course, such as introduction to object-oriented programming, C#, or Java.</p>
